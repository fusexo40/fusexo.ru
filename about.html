                    Hello everyone, my name is Ilya and I'm a full stack developer.
                    I am a programmer in languages ​​such as c#, c++, python, java script, html.
                    I've only been programming for a year and don't know much, so don't judge too harshly.
                    I also have a hobby. I like to play ping pong, draw and play computer games.
                </p>
